# Editing Codes

Brought to you by Open Strategy Partners.

Editing Codes are a collection of short, semantic editing marks to use when editing a piece of written content — your own or someone else’s.

**Explain, teach, learn.** The codes are based on specific [writing guidelines](https://github.com/open-strategy-partners/writing-guide). Use them to communicate the rationale behind a suggested change. They’re also a great way to share useful writing tips!

* Check out the [Editing Codes Quick Start Guide](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/osp-editing-codes-quick-start-guide/) to see how we approach editing, and view the codes in action.  
* Listen to us talking on our podcast about [how we write and edit at OSP](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/how-we-write-and-edit-at-osp-podcast-01/).

## How to use the Editing Codes

### Step one: Identify, Reflect, Consider

1. Read the piece of writing.
2. Encounter something that you want to give feedback on.
3. Pause a moment to reflect.
4. Find the code that represents the writing principle that underpins your feedback.
5. Be constructive! Everyone wants to improve their writing :-)

This takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get familiar with the codes it becomes second nature.

### Step two: Include the Code in your Feedback

1. Preface your feedback with the code.
2. Add your comments or suggestions. 

### Step Three: Praise. Always Be Positive.

Help your writer build good habits by telling them [what you like and what they do well](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/the-positivity-pass-and-why-we-do-it/).

Add a `++` to a code to praise a positive example of its use. You can follow with extra detail, or just let it stand alone.

### Step Four: Pass it on!
We hope our Editing Codes help you be a more mindful and transparent editor, and a more consistent writer!

Let your writer know that you used the editing codes to review their work. Link to this page or copy this:

## The OSP Editing Codes

The codes are organized into four editing phases to help you edit consistently.

* [Scope & Narrative Structure](#scope)
* [Flow & Readability](#flow)
* [Style & Phrasing](#style)
* [Word choice](#word)

## <a id="scope" />Process Phase A: Scope & Narrative Structure

| Category  | Editorial Code | Writing Principle |
| :---------| :------------: | :---------------- |
| Opening       | LEDE  | Don't bury the lead. In the article, or even in a sentence.    
| Opening       | [FRONT](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/front-the-osp-editorial-code-podcast-05/)  | Clearly identify your main point or idea up front.            |
| Opening       | SPFIC | Make the scenario or problem space specific. Avoid vague, general claims.                         |
| Opening       | WHOM  | Identify (explicitly or implicitly) your audience in the opening section. This is not a grammar issue, it is to help readers self-select and identify with a piece (or not).                                     |
| Opening       | WIIFM | Lead with the benefit. Clearly show why the audience will care about the idea/thesis in the opening section.  |
| Logical Rigor | POINT | Points supporting an argument, thesis, or claim can be strong, weak, or missing. This is somewhat subjective! Editors, please expand on this when you use this code.  |
| Logical Rigor | SPOCK | Use clear, logical thinking. Avoid logical fallacies. Check that all evidence is directly connected with a cause/effect relationship to the claim.   |
| Logical Rigor | FACT  | Back all factual claims by evidence with examples, testimonials, statistics or other research. Emotional claims are acceptable without evidence, especially in a quote like a testimonial.   
| Closing | CTA    | Close with a clear call to action.                                               
| Closing | SUMM   | Summarize your thesis and why it matters in the closing section.         |
| Closing | THESIS | Restate your thesis/main idea in the closing section, but do no simply repeat verbatim. |

## <a id="flow" />Process Phase B: Flow & Readability

| Category  | Editorial Code | Writing Principle |
| :---------| :------------: | :---------------- |
| Flow                    | FLOW  | Organize the sections and paragraphs in a logical order and ensure they have an elegant flow and transition to them.  |
| Flow                    | RHYTH | Be aware of the length of paragraphs, avoid overly long blocks of text. Stagger length. Create rhythm and visual variation for your reader.  |
| Structural Aids         | SUBHD | Relevant subheads assist the reader by breaking up copy and defining the purpose of each text block. _This is the structural perspective on the code HEAD_.                                                                                                                                      |
| Trust and evidence      | EXMPL | Examples enhance the thesis or claims by helping to create a picture in the readers mind.          |
| Trust and evidence      | [QUOTE](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/quote-the-osp-editorial-code-podcast-03/) | Quote your subject matter expert directly wherever possible to build trust, authority, and add interest.   |
| Trust and evidence      | TRUST | Where possible, mention or highlight signals of trust.                                                    |
| Tight Writing           | CASE  | Make sure each point in each paragraph is valid, relevant, and unique.                                     |
| Tight Writing           | CLUTT | Cut all clutter (no extraneous words, sentences, or paragraphs). If your words do not build the case toward the conclusion or your thesis, they are extraneous. Good writing is often a process of rewriting and editing with a critical eye. Judge your writing as if someone else wrote it. |
| Tight Writing           | TOOM  | Avoid over explaining or providing too much detail. Only explain what is relevant in the context of the article.         |
| Coherence & Readability | HEAD  | Relevant subheads assist the reader by breaking up copy and defining the purpose of each text block. _This is the readability perspective on the code HEAD_.                                                                                                                                     |
| Coherence & Readability | LIST  | Bulleted lists efficiently present information. This format is easily scannable and provides a visual break in the copy.|
| Coherence & Readability | WALL  | Use headers, paragraphs, blockquotes, and lists to add visual variation and interest.<br> A wall of words will put off a reader at a glance.  |
| Coherence & Readability | ILLUS | Add non-text explanations, metaphors, and data using photos, charts, diagrams, or illustrations where possible. Images provide visual interest and a variation in long articles.<br> A picture is worth 1000 words for conveying some kinds of information efficiently.             |
| Audience                | SEP   | Separation of concerns. Sometimes two different points are combined in a single sentence when they should be made separately. This can also apply to a paragraph, section of an article, or even an extraneous topic in one post that you can remove or break out into its own article.             |

## <a id="style" />Process Phase C: Style & Phrasing

| Category  | Editorial Code | Writing Principle |
| :---------| :------------: | :---------------- |
| Audience                             | CNECT  | Use language that will connect with your target audience, but avoid jargon that will prevent non-experts from gaining value from your writing.    |
| Audience                             | EMPATH | Write with the needs, problems, perspective of the target audience in mind.    |
| Grammar, Style and Phrasing          | ANLGY  | Use analogies to help make raw (dull) data more interesting and help people visualise it. e.g. "That's enough people to fill 2/3 of Yankee Stadium."  |
| Tone                                 | CRIT   | Hidden or implied criticism. Don’t tell people they’re "doing it wrong". Externalise the problem away from the reader, "a common mistake is."     |
| Tone                                 | BRAND  | Match the tone to the client's brand guidelines.    |
| Tone                                 | TONE   | Match the tone for the right use case (eg. Support versus Marketing). Follow client voice guidelines where provided.  |
| Tone                                 | FUD    | Avoid negative copy and FUD marketing (fear, uncertainty, doubt). We want to make a positive difference in the world. Highlighting the positive, the benefits or USPs a given product offers is far stronger and clearer in our opinion than resorting to criticizing the competition.   |
| Trust and evidence                   | HYPER  | Avoid hyperbole, exaggeration, binary comparisions (good/bad), and claims you can't back up.   |
| Tight Writing                        | [CRISP](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/crisp-the-osp-editorial-code-podcast-02/)  | Write sentences that are spare and concise. Use occasional longer sentences to vary the rhythm of your writing. Aim for active voice, rhythm, and pace. Avoid flowery, long-winded words and sentences.  |
| Tight Writing                        | REDUN  | Avoid redundant words (for example, future plans, unexpected surprise, most optimized).    |
| Inclusive and human-centric language | INCL   | Use inclusive lanaguage to make sure readers feel respected and welcomed. Avoid language that shows prejudice, bias, discrimination, or a lack of sensitivity.    |
| Inclusive and human-centric language | JUDG   | Replace subjective evaluations or judgements with specific outcomes or needs.   |
| Inclusive and human-centric language | [PAX](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/pax-the-osp-editorial-code-podcast-06/) |Aim to use non-violent language by replacing metaphors around war, sports, and sex, with more peaceful, constructive ones like art, carpentry, or gardening.     |
| Inclusive and human-centric language | DIRCT  | Use direct address when appropriate. Make instructions simple and direct. For example, replace "Please be aware that we can also make instructions simple and direct," with "Make instructions simeple and direct."   |
| Accessibility                        | A11Y   | Write for accessibility. We love The Stanford Online Accessibility Program guide on this.  |
| Accessibility                        | SIMPL  | Use simple language where possible. This is especially important for international audiences.   |
| Phrasing                             | FEEL   | Your sentences should create pictures, feelings, emotions for the reader.  |
| Phrasing                             | DIR    | Use the direct path to the explanation. Avoid longwinded paths to the point.   |
| Phrasing                             | KISS   | Avoid making points sound needlessly complicated.   |
| Phrasing                             | [REPET](https://openstrategypartners.com/blog/repet-the-osp-editorial-code-podcast-04/) | Avoid careless repetition.  |
| Phrasing                             | FRESH  | Avoid cliches or stale expressions.   |
| Phrasing                             | METPH  | Be consistent if you use a metaphor. Try to carry it through the entire article and/or its logical conclusion.  |
| Phrasing                             | COLOR  | Color and energy. Choose interesting, exciting ways to express things—but not at the expense of clarity.  |
| Phrasing                             | CLEAR  | Clear writing. Avoid vague descriptions of benefits. Be as specific as possible.     |

## <a id="word" />Process Phase D: Word Choice

| Category  | Editorial Code | Writing Principle |
| :---------| :------------: | :---------------- |
| Strong verbs            | ACTIV | Use the active voice (mostly) to center the reader in the action. Check if gerund (-ing) phrases are weakening your message.     |
| Strong verbs            | VERBS | Replace common, weak or vague verbs with more specific, colorful ones.  |
| Strong verbs            | LEAD  | Lead with verbs and actions.                                           |
| Strong verbs            | TENSE | Tense. Check it’s in the right tense and consistent throughout.     |
| Accuracy & Terminology  | AMBIG | Avoid ambiguity. Avoid being vague. Word choice can leave things open to interpretation. Be as specific as possible.  |
| Accuracy & Terminology  | TERM  | Technical terms and technology names: Explain what they are and what they do to make sure your audience (at relevant levels of experience) are all on the same page with you. Define technical terms directly in the article. Link to other articles with deeper explanations, where it makes sense.<br>Ensure technical accuracy (research, ask an expert, ask the client). Mistakes of this type can impact overall credibility of the content. |
| Accuracy & Terminology  | BUZZ  | Replace jargon, buzzwords, and clichés with a clear and concise statement that expresses your point. This can be expressions like "clear as a bell" or technical acronyms. The former lacks any specific information helpful to the reader, while the latter can prevent a reader who is not an expert in the field from understanding the content.      |
| Accuracy & Terminology  | ACRO  | Acronyms - explain what they stand for (what they are, what they do).    |
| Accuracy & Terminology  | DATE  | Stay current and relevant, don’t date your content. ("Last September," "earlier this year," etc.)     |
| Accuracy & Terminology  | ANTE  | Be clear about what "this, "that", "they" refer to.                |
| Grammar and punctuation | GRAM  | Check for grammar errors.                                               |
| Grammar and punctuation | MODIF | Put modifiers (words that alter others) in the correct order.         |
