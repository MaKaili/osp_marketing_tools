# Open Strategy Partners (OSP) Product Communication Value Map Guide

## Purpose
This guide instructs LLMs how to analyze product documentation and create value maps that inform strategic communication. It enables evaluation and generation of product communications based on Open Strategy Partners' framework.

## Core Process Overview

1. Input Analysis
2. Value Map Creation
3. Communication Generation & Evaluation

## 1. Input Analysis

### Document Processing
- Parse all provided product documentation, technical specifications, and marketing materials
- Extract and categorize information into:
  - Technical features
  - Functionality descriptions
  - Use cases
  - Target audience indicators
  - Current marketing messages

### Technical Truth Extraction
1. Identify concrete, verifiable capabilities
2. Separate marketing claims from actual functionality
3. Map technical features to business outcomes
4. Note integration points and technical dependencies

## 2. Value Map Creation

### Component Hierarchy
Generate hierarchical structure:

1. Product Level
   - Create product tagline (2-8 words)
   - Generate positioning statement
   - Identify USPs
   - Develop solution statements

2. Feature Categories
   - Group related feature areas
   - Name each category
   - Create category tagline
   - Develop category value case

3. Feature Areas
   - Group related features
   - Name each area
   - Create area tagline
   - Develop area value case

4. Individual Features
   - List concrete functionalities
   - Map to parent feature areas

### Value Case Construction
For each Feature Category and Feature Area, create:

1. Benefit Statement
   - What value does it deliver?
   - Format: Concrete, measurable outcomes
   - Must connect to business impact
   - Example: "Reduces deployment time by 40%"

2. Challenge Statement
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Format: Current pain point or limitation
   - Must be specific and relatable
   - Example: "Manual deployments cause frequent errors"

3. Solution Statement
   - How does it solve the challenge?
   - Format: Technical capability leading to benefit
   - Must link features to outcomes
   - Example: "Automated CI/CD pipeline with built-in testing"

## 3. Communication Generation & Evaluation

### Content Creation Rules
Apply these principles to all generated content:

1. Tight
   - Remove filler words
   - Use precise verbs
   - One idea per statement

2. Specific
   - No generic claims
   - Include concrete examples
   - Use exact numbers when available

3. Accurate
   - Only verifiable statements
   - No comparative claims without evidence
   - Link claims to technical capabilities

4. Clean & Consistent
   - Maintain professional tone
   - Use defined terminology
   - Follow brand voice guidelines

5. Compelling
   - Active voice
   - Strong verbs
   - Clear value proposition

6. Functional
   - Purpose-driven content
   - Clear next actions
   - Matches audience needs

### Content Evaluation Process
When evaluating existing content:

1. Map each statement to value map components
2. Check alignment with technical truth
3. Verify adherence to principles
4. Score on specific metrics:
   - Accuracy (matches technical truth)
   - Clarity (understandable to target audience)
   - Value communication (links features to benefits)
   - Call to action effectiveness

### Component Generation Guide

#### Taglines
- Length: 2-8 words
- Purpose: Attention-grabbing introduction
- Style: Can use wordplay, alliteration
- Must: Connect to core value proposition

#### Positioning Statements
Formula: "[product], in [category] helps [audience] achieve [benefit] who [need] by [method]"

#### Value Cases
Structure:
1. Lead with benefit (transformation)
2. Present challenge (pain point)
3. Explain solution (technical capability)

#### CTAs and CTVs
- CTA: Direct action command
- CTV: Value-focused outcome statement
- Both: Under 8 words

## Value Map Updates

### When New Information Arrives
1. Analyze new information using Input Analysis process
2. Compare with existing value map
3. Update affected components:
   - Add new features
   - Revise value cases
   - Adjust positioning if needed
4. Maintain consistency across hierarchy
5. Re-validate all connections

### Consistency Checks
After updates, verify:
1. All features map to areas
2. All areas map to categories
3. All value cases align
4. Technical truth maintained
5. Messaging consistency

## Communication Pattern Library

### Feature Description Pattern
```
[Feature Name] enables [user type] to [action] by [method], resulting in [benefit].
```

### Value Case Pattern
```
[Benefit Statement: Positive outcome]
[Challenge Statement: Current problem]
[Solution Statement: How product solves it]
```

### Positioning Pattern
```
For [audience] who [need], [product] provides [key benefit]. Unlike [alternative], our product [key differentiator].
```

## Response Templates

### Value Map Summary
```
Product: [Name]
Tagline: [2-8 words]
Key Categories:
- [Category 1]
  - [Key Features]
  - [Value Case]
- [Category 2]
  - [Key Features]
  - [Value Case]
```

### Content Evaluation
```
Analysis of: [Content Type]
Technical Accuracy: [Score] - [Evidence]
Value Communication: [Score] - [Evidence]
Improvement Suggestions:
1. [Suggestion]
2. [Suggestion]
```

## Principles for LLM Application

1. Always ground responses in technical truth
2. Maintain consistency across all outputs
3. Adapt language to audience technical level
4. Prefer specific over general statements
5. Link features to business outcomes
6. Update value map with each new input
7. Validate all claims against documentation
8. Generate measurable benefits where possible
9. Keep source attribution for all claims
10. Flag assumptions and inferential leaps

## Error Prevention

1. Avoid generic tech marketing terms
2. Never make unsubstantiated comparisons
3. Don't generate technical claims without evidence
4. Prevent message dilution
5. Maintain proper hierarchy relationships
6. Don't mix audience levels inappropriately
7. Avoid feature-benefit mismatches
8. Prevent value proposition inconsistencies
