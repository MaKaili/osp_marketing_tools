# Chair Statement writing guide

## Overview

A Chair statement is typically a formal document or speech by the chairperson of a company or organization, summarizing financial performance, strategic initiatives, and future plans, aimed at stakeholders like shareholders and employees. The main purpose of a chair statement is to reflect on the activity, operations, finances and achievements over the previous financial reporting year. It’s generally very upbeat and positive and focuses on the highlights of the period, before looking forward to the coming year. 

## Section to include

- A welcome to the new staff who joined during the period as well as fond goodbyes to those who left
- A summary of the top-line activity during the previous period, including highlights and best bits 
- Any big achievements, awards, major clients, news or big wins
- Acknowledgement and thanks to external donors, stakeholders and shareholders
- Acknowledgement and thanks to internal teams
- Relevant special announcements for the upcoming year
- An announcement of future initiatives and the way forward

## How to Write a Chair Statement

### Research and Planning

- Identify Your Audience: Determine who will read the statement (e.g., shareholders, employees) and their information needs.
- Keyword Research: Use tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, or Google Keyword Planner to find terms like "company performance 2025" or "chairperson report."
- Content Depth: Cover subtopics like financial results, strategic goals, and future plans, including data or case studies for credibility.

### Optimize Meta Tags
Title Tag: Keep under 60 characters, include the primary keyword, e.g., "2025 Chair Statement: Company Performance Insights."
- Meta Description: Under 160 characters, with a call-to-action like "Read our 2025 Chair statement for key insights," avoiding duplication of the introduction.

### Structure and Content
- Use headings (H1, H2, H3) to organize content, making it scannable, e.g., "Financial Highlights" or "Future Strategy."
- Integrate keywords naturally in the introduction, headings, and body, avoiding keyword stuffing.
- Include internal links to relevant pages, like the company's annual report, using descriptive anchor text, e.g., "View our full financials here."

### Enhance with Structured Data
- Add Schema Markup, such as FAQ or Review schemas, to improve visibility in search results and boost click-through rates (CTR).

### Promote and Measure
- Share the statement on social media platforms like LinkedIn and X, and consider Google Ads for broader reach.
- Track performance metrics like CTR, bounce rate, and time on page using Google Analytics to refine future statements.

Organisation overview: Organisation123’s mission is to make the world a better place through technology and education.

Dear Organisation123 members,

2022 was another excellent year for us. We hit some key milestones and turned a team of nine members into a team of thirteen! We’d like you to join us in welcoming new starters Megan Moffit, James Jury, Danny Daelish and Sarah Smith to the team and thanking them for their contributions so far. We also said goodbye to Harry Hill this year who, we can all agree, had a big impact during his time here.

Some of my personal highlights from our activity this year include:

- Merging with Organisation456 to expand our offering into new regions.
- Raising £10,000 between the team with various initiatives for charity.
- Increasing our customer base by 67%. 
- Our mentions in the national press, including The Telegraph, BBC and our new TV advertisement.
As always, we must extend our gratitude to CompanyX for their sponsorship and financial support, as well as to donors Michelle Mathers and Ewan Einstein for their constant and continued support.

Our success is also directly linked to the hard work of our team. We have made extraordinary progress this year, and I’d like to personally thank every team member for their energy, commitment and consistency in driving our business forward.

This year, our plans for expansion include:

- A new in-house telesales team.
- Further investments into our technology. 
- Sourcing a creative agency to support our marketing ambitions.
There are also some plans that are in their very early stages, but I look forward to sharing them with you all soon.

Thank you all for another excellent year. I look forward to continuing to break barriers in 2023 with you all.
