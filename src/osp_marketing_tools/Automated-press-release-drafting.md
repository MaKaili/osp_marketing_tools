# Automated Press Release Drafting Guide  

## Overview  
An automated press release is a digitally generated document that communicates newsworthy updates (e.g., product launches, mergers, financial results) to media outlets, stakeholders, and the public. Automation streamlines drafting by using templates, natural language generation (NLG), and data integration tools, ensuring consistency, speed, and SEO optimization. These releases are designed to maintain a professional tone while reducing manual effort, often integrating real-time data feeds for accuracy.

## How to Write an Automated Press Release  

### 1. Research and Data Integration  
- **Identify Data Sources**: Pull real-time data from APIs (e.g., CRM systems, financial databases) to auto-populate figures like revenue or user stats.  
- **Keyword Research**: Use tools like SEMrush or AnswerThePublic to target terms like "AI innovation 2024" or "sustainable tech solutions."  
- **Audience Analysis**: Tailor language for journalists, investors, or consumers.  

### 2. Template Development  
- Create reusable templates with variables (e.g., `[Company Name]`, `[Product]`, `[Date]`).  
- Tools: Use AI platforms like Jasper, ChatGPT, or Copy.ai for dynamic content generation.  

### 3. SEO Optimization  
- **Title Tag**: Keep under 60 characters (e.g., "GreenTech Co. Reduces Carbon Footprint by 40% in 2024").  
- **Meta Description**: Summarize the release in 160 characters, including keywords like "sustainability report 2024."  
- **Internal Links**: Link to related pages (e.g., "Explore our sustainability initiatives [here](#)").  

### 4. Content Generation  
- **NLG Tools**: Automate body text using platforms like Articoolo or Wordsmith.  
- **Dynamic Quotes**: Pull pre-approved quotes from a database (e.g., CEO statements).  

### 5. Structured Data Markup  
- Implement Schema.org’s [PressRelease schema](https://schema.org/NewsArticle) to enhance search visibility.  
- Include elements like `datePublished`, `author`, and `associatedMedia`.  

### 6. Review and Customization  
- **Human Oversight**: Edit for tone, accuracy, and brand voice.  
- **A/B Testing**: Experiment with headlines or CTAs using tools like Optimizely.  

### 7. Automated Distribution  
- Integrate with PR distribution platforms (e.g., PR Newswire, Business Wire) for instant publishing.  
- Schedule social media shares via Hootsuite or Buffer.
