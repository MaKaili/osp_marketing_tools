# Editing Codes

These [editing codes](codes.md) are a collection of short, semantic editing marks to use when you're editing a piece of written content.

Editing shouldn't be a black box. These codes communicate the rationale behind a suggested edit, based on a specific writing guideline.

When reviewing a written piece of content, use a code to support your editorial comment or suggestion. 

## Who is this for?

This guide is for OSP team members and anyone who wants to learn how we work. We created structures, workflows, and processes to help us communicate authentically â€” on behalf of our clients and ourselves. 

## Contributing to the codes

We've based the editing codes on principles in our [Writing Guide]https://github.com/open-strategy-partners/writing-guide). This is a living collection - if we missed something, please log an issue to let us know.

You can use these codes as-is, or clone this repo and add your own codes to support your in-house style guide. We would love your suggestions and feedback. To collaborate, create an issue in this repo or open a pull request.
